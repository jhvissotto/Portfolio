# Dictionary

**RSA:** Asymmetric encryption algorithm (uses public and private keys).

**AES:** Symmetric encryption algorithm (same key for encryption and decryption).

**256:** Key size (256 bits) — more bits = more security.

**CBC:** "Cipher Block Chaining" — AES operating mode, each block depends on the previous one.

**Salt:** Random value added before creating a hash, to prevent dictionary attacks.

**Rounds:** Number of times an operation (such as hashing) is repeated to increase security.

**Hash:** Function that transforms data into a fixed sequence of bits (irreversible).

**Signature:** Digital signature — proof that a message came from the owner of the private key.

**Token:** Digital representation of something (access, identity, financial asset) used for authentication or secure transfer.
